Instructions for installing NWB Matlab bridge API.

This directory contins the "matlab_bridge" for the NWB format.
The matlab_bridge implements an API to the NWB format by interfacing
MatLab to the Python NWB API.

To setup the matlab_bridge, do the following:

1. Install the Python NWB API.  This is required because the matlab_bridge
   works by calling the Python NWB API from matlab.  So the Python API
   *must* be working on your system first.

2. Determine the location of the Python interpreter   that is being used
   to run the Python NWB API.  To do this, first, verify that you have
   the Python NWB API installed by running one of the Python NWB API
   example scripts or unittests from the command line.  You can also
   enter the following command into the shell:
   
   python -m nwb.h5diffci
   
   If the NWB API is correctly installed,
   you should get an output message something like the following:
   
   Usage: /Users/jt/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nwb/h5diffci.py <file1.h5> [<file2.h5>]

   (The path will be different, the message should start with 'Usage:').

   Once you get output like the above, type the following commands in the
   shell:
    python
    import sys
    print (sys.executable)
   
   The first command will start the Python interpreter  .  The third command
   will display the location of the Python interpreter  .
   Example output is shown below:
$ python  
Python 2.7.11 |Anaconda 2.4.1 (x86_64)| (default, Dec  6 2015, 18:57:58) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577)] on darwin

>>> import sys
>>> print sys.executable
/Users/jt/anaconda/bin/python
>>> quit()

quit() is entered to exit the Python interpreter.  From the above output, the
location of the Python interpreter   is:
"/Users/jt/anaconda/bin/python".


3. Specify the location of the Python interpreter to MatLab.
   To do this, startup MatLab, and enter "pyversion" into the MatLab
   command window.  Output should be something like this:

>> pyversion

       version: '2.7'
    executable: '/Users/jt/anaconda/bin/python'
       library: '/Users/jt/anaconda/lib/libpython2.7.dylib'
          home: '/Users/jt/anaconda'
      isloaded: 0

   If the location of the executable displayed by "pyversion" matches the location
   you found in step 2, then matlab is already setup to use the correct Python
   interpreter and you can move onto step 4.  Otherwise,  you must specify
   the location of the Python interpreter to matlab.  Do that by entering:

   pyversion '/path/to/your/python'

   You should only need to do this once.  (It will be used in your future
   matlab sessions).  More information about this can be found in the matlab
   documentation for pyversion.


4. Add the 'matlab_bridge_api' directory to your matlab path.  Do this by
   clicking on the "Set Path" icon in MatLab, and navigating to directory
   "matlab_bridge/matlab_bridge_api", and add that directory to your matlab
   search path.

5. Tell Matlab not to abort if the Python API uses a different HDF5 version.
   Matlab has its own copy of the HDF5 library internally, but the NWB
   Python API will be using your system's HDF5 library (or one in a conda
   environment, depending on how you built the API). If these are different
   versions, by default HDF5 will make Matlab abort. You can disable this
   check with the Matlab command `setenv('HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK', '1')`
   before using any NWB features. Different versions of HDF5 in the 1.8
   series are usually compatible enough to work together.

If everything is working you should be able to run the matlab unit tests
by going to directory
"matlab_bridge/matlab_unittest"

in matlab, then entering "run_all_tests".
Output should be like the following:

>> run_all_tests
t_annotation.m PASSED
t_append.m PASSED
t_array_layout.m PASSED
t_epoch_tag.m PASSED
t_general_ephys.m PASSED
t_general_image.m PASSED
t_general_opto.m PASSED
t_general_patch.m PASSED
t_general_species.m PASSED
t_general_top.m PASSED
t_if_add_ts.m PASSED
t_if_isi.m PASSED
t_modification_time.m PASSED
t_no_data.m PASSED
t_no_time.m PASSED
t_ref_image.m PASSED
t_softlink.m PASSED
t_starting_time.m PASSED
t_timeseries_link.m PASSED
t_top_datasets.m PASSED
t_unittimes.m PASSED

You should also be able to run the sample scripts in directory
"matlab_bridge/matlab_examples/create_scripts".  Example output from
running script "abstract_feature.m" is shown below:

>> pwd

ans =

/Users/jt/crcns/dev/api-python/matlab_bridge/matlab_examples/create_scripts

>> ls
abstract_feature.m	analysis_e.m		crcns_alm_1.m		run_all_examples.m

>> abstract_feature()
script_name is "abstract_feature.m"
nwb_file_name is "abstract_feature.nwb"
